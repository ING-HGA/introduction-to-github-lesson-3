title: Development and coupling of a portable and modular mass analyzer to a biorreactor for culture gases monitoring to determinate biological status
---

I am a pHD studen, from TECN campus Celaya, in colaboration with The Laboratory of Analysis Biochemical and Instrumental, at CINVESTAV-Irapuato. A laboraoty foccused on Mass Spectrometry (MS) for biological samples.

My current proyect is to coupled a portable and modular mass analyzer (MoBiMS) to a bioreactor to monitorize gase's culture on real-time. With this information I will train a machine learning model (ML) to determinate the biological state of the culture for interest molecule production optimization. My biological model to tes this technological develptment is Saccharomyces serevisiae, a yeast with a Crabtree Efect which enable the yeast to produce ethanol under aerobic conditions if carbon source exceeded the critical concentration.

For integrative proyect I try to combine diverse skills like:
- Mass Spectrometry
- Data analysis
- 3D printing for prototyping
- Coding for automation in ML, data analysis and interface for user
- Biorreactore control
